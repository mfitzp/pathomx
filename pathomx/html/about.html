    <h2>Welcome to Pathomx v2.3</h2>
    <p>Pathomx is a workflow-based tool for the analysis of metabolomic and other omics datasets. It is interactive, visual, extensible, intelligent and free for any use.</p>

    <p>This release brings:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>MATLAB and R integration. Run scripts on your locally installed MATLAB/R platforms directly from within Pathomx. Manipulate data using external tools.
    <li>MATLAB data export, export datasets directly to MATLAB format workspace files
    <li>NMRLab integration. Native wrappers for MATLAB-based NMR processing tools.
    <li>Improved figure outputs
    <li>Numerous bug fixes and improvements
    </ul>    

    <p>To report bugs, or request features see our <a href="http://github.com/pathomx/pathomx/issues">issue tracker on Github</a>, to 
    get tips see the <a href="http://docs.pathomx.org">online documentation</a>, or 
    for more information see <a href="http://pathomx.org">the Pathomx project website</a>.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The key to analysis with Pathomx is the <em>workflow</em>. In data analysis it is common to perform a number of repeated steps in order,
    taking outputs of one action and feeding them into the next step in the analysis. In many cases the conversion from the output of one
    application to the input of another must be performed manually. For complex datasets this can significantly extend the time taken from
    getting data to finding results. Pathomx aims to solve this problem through the use of reusable, customisable, workflows. Workflows allow a number of processing
    steps to be connected together into a complex, parallel, system.</p>

    <h2>Quick Start</h2>

    <p>To get started, simply click on the sidebar and select 'Import'. Here you can select the type of data to import using one of the 
    provided import plugins. There are a number of example datafiles available on the <a href="http://pathomx.org">Pathomx website</a>.</p>

    <p>Once you've imported a dataset, you can then proceed to analyse it. Click on the Analysis tab and select PCA to perform Principal Components Analysis. The Scores plot
    will be shown immediately, with the principal component weight plots available on the tabs below.</p>

    <img src="file:///@htmlbase/img/help-data-pca-wrong.png">
    
    <p>If you click back to the Home tab, you will now see the Workspace view - showing your data source connected to the PCA analysis app. 
    This is how all analysis is performed in Pathomx, by connecting apps to data sources (or the outputs of other apps). You'll notice
    that these two have been connected automatically for you by making a best guess of what you want. If something is connected wrongly
    it is simple to fix - simply drag the yellow output port onto the orange input port.</p>

    <img src="file:///@htmlbase/img/help-data-pca.png">
    
    <p>If your input data is not mean centred you may have noticed the PCA weights plots are a not centred around a zero-point. To fix this
    we need to mean center the data before applying the PCA. Click on the Processing tab and select 'Transform' to launch a simple app providing 
    basic data-transformation options. On the Transform toolbar select 'Mean centre' from the drop down menu (containing 'log2').</p>

    <p>If you go back to your workspace you'll see that the application has guessed wrongly and connected the mean centring to the output 
    of the PCA. It has made this assumption on the basis of the order you have added the applications. So correct the order by first dragging from the
    output of your data input to the input of the Mean Centre app, then from the output of the Mean Centre app to the input for PCA.</p>

    <img src="file:///@htmlbase/img/help-data-pca-mc-done.png">
    
    <p>If you now return to the PCA app (click on it) you'll see the corrected, mean centered PCA.</p>

    <p>While this has taken a few minutes to set up, you can save this workflow for future use by using <em>File > Save Workflow As...</em>.


    <img src="file:///@htmlbase/img/help-data-pca-mc-inline-view.png">
    
    <p>Another useful features is the inline views that are available from most tools. Simply right-click and select a view from the drop
    down list under Views, and it will be pinned onto the current workflow. These views automatically update as processing occurs, so you 
    can get a instant overview of what is happening under the hood.</p>
